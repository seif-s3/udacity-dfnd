However I never dogged deeper to learn about the foundation or the process of making these new technologies it takes a lot of parts to create this magical ideas. As for me it started from a simple experience. I've met with people at my work place who are experienced with excel. they showed me how working with excel can be so magical. as you can turn a really time consuming task by making a small project, saving you 25 minutes of less accurate process, to less than 5 minutes accurately achieved. I learned how to copy paste info from a sheet to another by using excel forms and I was successful. The projected included charge sheets. we use to charge patient expenses in the hospital. I used to print out the papers and stamp them with names and room numbers (or write them if I could not find blue plates). However, instead I made the formula to copy paste the patients information from the Hospital apps to the excel and I would get perfectly organized sheets with the names on them. it took me one day to google and find the things and another day to implement and tweak a little here and there until I was able to achieve satisfying results. I gave little course of how to use it and the staff actually started printing it out.
